## Creating Tables for Reports Using SQL

To effectively use Crystal Reports with your data, you may need to create or modify tables in your database. Here's a quick guide on how to create a basic table that can be utilized in your reports:

### Example: Creating a Sales Report Table

1. **Open your SQL database management tool** and connect to your database.

2. **Execute the following SQL statement** to create a table named `SalesReport`:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE SalesReport (
        ReportID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        ProductName VARCHAR(255),
        QuantitySold INT,
        SaleDate DATE,
        TotalSaleAmount DECIMAL(10, 2)
    );
    ```

3. **Insert sample data** into `SalesReport` table to test your report:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO SalesReport (ReportID, ProductName, QuantitySold, SaleDate, TotalSaleAmount)
    VALUES 
    (1, 'Widget A', 100, '2023-01-01', 2000.00),
    (2, 'Widget B', 150, '2023-01-02', 3000.00),
    (3, 'Gadget C', 200, '2023-01-03', 4500.00);
    ```

4. **Use Crystal Reports** to connect to your database and select the `SalesReport` table as the data source for your report.

By following these steps, you can create a simple table in your SQL database and populate it with data to generate meaningful reports using Crystal Reports.
